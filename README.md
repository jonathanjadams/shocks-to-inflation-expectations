# Shocks to Inflation Expectations: Replication Code

This repository contains the replication package for the following paper:

* Jonathan J Adams and Philip Barrett "Shocks to Inflation Expectations",  *Review of Economic Dynamics*, (2024).

## Required Software and Packages

Estimation exercises were carried out in `R`.  Simulations were carried out in `Matlab` and analyzed in `R`.

A full list of the `R` packages needed to replicate our results is as follows:

  * `ggplot`
  * `etc.`
  * `etc.`
  * `etc.`

The Matlab replication was confirmed on version XXXX, and also requires the following toolkits (which are included in the replication files):

  * `Uhlig Toolkit`
  * `BEET Toolkit`

## Model Solutions

Code for our simulations appears in the directory `simulations` which
contains three subdirectories:

  * `NAME1` contains code to replicate ...
  * `NAME2` contains code to replicate ...
  * `NAME3` contains code to replicate ...

## Empirical Analysis


Datasets are somewhere.  Code is also somewhere.
